This project demonstrates development using terraform for multi-cloud scenarios across AWS and GCP.

# Development Infrastructure

The following section provides details about how to setup development environment

# Pre-requisite

Ensure that the following tools are installed and setup

1. Git
2. Terraform
3. GNUpg (GPG)
4. base64
5. tar
6. gunzip/gzip

In addition to that depending on the environment being created, one of the following tools must be available.

1. AWS CLI (aws)
2. GCP SDK (gcloud)

## AWS 

TODO: Add environment image

### Environment setup

The environment setup should be run from a machine with internet access to enable terraform to download plugins.

1. Ensure that a valid AWS profile has been configured with an identity having `AdministratorAccess` permission for initial setup.
2. Set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to Github PAT with `repo` permission to update repo environment variables.
3. If a new environment needs to be setup, run the following commands after replacing `<Environment name>` with name of 
   the environment (without spaces and 3 letters), `<AWS profile>` with name of AWS profile to use to setup environment,
   and `<AWS region>` to identify the region to deploy.

     ```bash
     git clone -b infra-core --recursive git@github.com:shekhar-jha/base-demo.git     git checkout infra-core
     cd base-demo/infra/aws/core 
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ./setup.sh -e <Environment name> -c <AWS profile> -r <AWS region> -d
     ```
     This will ensure that all the dependencies are created and initial state and keys will be saved for future reference.
      The `-d` triggers the download of `Terraform` plugins.
4. After initial deployment, please set the `RUNNER_PAT` environment secret with a Github PAT with `manage_runners:enterprise`
   and `public_repo` access.
5. Most of the build process involves creation of AWS components. The last part involves building the EC2 environment to 
   build images and run git-runner. In order to debug this process, connect to EC2 instance (using SSM) and check the build process
   ```bash
   $ aws --profile <AWS profile> --region <AWS Region> \
     ssm start-session --target <instance id>

   Starting session with SessionId: CORE_INFRA-█████████████████

   ```
   The output above shows successful run. If everything completes successfully, the ECS Instances tab of
   ECS cluster created will have an entry for the server.
6. Update the infrastructure using `apply.sh` 
     ```bash
     cd base-demo/infra/aws/core 
     chmod +x apply.sh
     ./apply.sh -e <Environment name> -c <AWS profile> -r <AWS region> 
     ```
     Note that `-d` is not passed during apply since the plugins are stored as part of state package.

### Environment cleanup

Environment can be destroyed and cleaned up using `destroy.sh` script.
```bash
cd base-demo/infra/aws/core
chmod +x destroy.sh
./destroy.sh -e <Environment name> -c <AWS profile> -r <AWS region>
```

# GCP

The GCP environment consists of the following components
TODO: Image and description

## Environment setup

The environment setup should be run from a machine with internet access to enable terraform to download plugins.

1. Ensure that either the following command has been run or you have credential file to login during execution
   ```google cloud
   gcloud auth application-default login
   gcloud auth login
   ```
2. Set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to Github PAT with `repo` permission to update repo environment variables.
3. If a new environment needs to be setup, run the following commands after replacing `<Environment name>` with name of
   the environment (without spaces and 3 letters), `<Project>` with name of GCP project to use to setup environment,
   and `<GCP region>` to identify the region to deploy.

     ```bash
     git clone -b infra-core --recursive git@github.com:shekhar-jha/base-demo.git     git checkout infra-core
     cd base-demo/infra/gcp/core 
     chmod +x g-setup.sh
     ./g-setup.sh -e <Environment name> -p <Project> -r <GCP region> -d
     ```
   This will ensure that all the dependencies are created and initial state and keys will be saved for future reference.
   The `-d` triggers the download of `Terraform` plugins.
